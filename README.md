# Java Swing Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java Swing.

## Game Mechanics:

- **Snake Movement**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) 
- **Apple**: Randomly appears on the board.
- **Collision Detection**: If the snake collides with itself or the board's boundaries, the game ends.
- **Scoring**: The score increases each time the snake eats an apple.

## How to Play:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile and run the `Snake.java` file.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
4. Eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the board.

## Features:

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Classic Snake game mechanics.
- Graphics implemented using Java Swing for cross-platform compatibility.
